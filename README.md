* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle length & Ground clearance provide the most significant amount of variance due to the output of these variables significance codes.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Slope is not considered to be equal to zero because the summarzed p-value is significantly lower than our r-squared value.

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model does not effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because there are more coefficients with less than ideal variability within the dataset.
